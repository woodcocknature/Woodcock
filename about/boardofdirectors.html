She worked for many years at Hocking College, in the school of Natural Resources, which is how she learned of the Woodcock Nature Preserve. She joined the board because she believes in the mission, and wanted another opportunity to expose her students to hands-on conservation practices.  Spending time in nature is her favorite thing to do, and when she is not doing that in her spare time, she enjoys spending time with her family and friends.</p>

He has taught at Hocking for 30 plus years in the School of Natural Resources  including many courses in biology, Ecology, conservation, watershed management and many skill based courses. He served as Chair of the Recreation and Wildlife Management  degree. He is currently the Director of the School of Natural Resources International Field School. He also serves as vice president of the Hocking River Commission and organization dedicated to conservation, restoration, education, and public access along the Hocking River. Over there, they manage 8 properties in the three counties the Hocking flows through. He has worked for NRCS, ODNR, and over the years volunteered with the Raccoon Creek Partnership, Sunday Creek Watershed, Monday Creek Restoration Project, The Arc of Appalachia and now the Woodcock Nature Preserve. In the big picture, Ron hopes to leave this world a better place than when he came into it. As a child, Ron watched the Cuyahoga River Burn and last summer he watched a fisherman catch a Walleye in that very same spot the river burnt. He feels if we work hard we can continue this trend and fix many of the wrongs we have created.</p>
