            <h1 class="center">Who We Are</h1>
            <p>The Woodcock Nature Preserve was established by David and Helen Horn, with the help of their daughter Becky Ferguson and their friends Bob Scott Placier and Benjamin Stewart. The Horns lived busy lives as cattle ranchers with up to 200 heads of cattle, hobbyists of birding and botanizing, active members of their Quaker Church, and supporters of social justice causes. In 2008, they retired from ranching and decided to put conservation easement on their land with the Athens Conservancy, leading to the founding of Woodcock Nature Preserve as a 501(c)(3) organization. </p>

            <p>They proposed that the preserve should carry out the activities of re-establishing a biologically-diverse ecosystem to restore a native Appalachian foothill ecosystem in South Eastern Ohio, planting seedlings of desirable native hardwood species as part of such restoration project, testing alternative management practices for the elimination of invasive alien species, providing both present and long-term opportunities for scientists to conduct research activities of all kinds (specifically relating to the evaluation of biodiversity, ecological succession after removal of invasive species, and wildlife habitat restoration), and developing programs for outdoor education, including hiking trails and opportunities for hands-on environmental education.

            <p>Since the establishment of the nature preserve, they have accomplished many of their goals. In 2011, they partnered with Hocking College and Pheasants Forever to transition the 45 acres of open ground on the southern end of the property to a mosaic of native grasslands and scrublands. In 2019, Woodcock Nature Preserve began collaborating with Paradise Ecological Services to begin prescribed fire activities on the preserve aimed at reducing and controlling these woody invasive species. In 2020, Woodcock Nature Preserve began collaborating with Southern Ohio Chestnut Company to plant and tend 25 acres of former pasture on the northern end of the property for planting chestnuts and pawpaws in a Muti-level food forest. In 2022, The Friendship Trail was opened to the public. This 5k (3.1 mile) loop from and back to the visitor parking lot is open to hikers, runners and mountain bilkers, sun-up to sun-down, year-round except for deer hunting season. In 2023, Woodcock Nature Preserve partnered with Dr. Kelly Williams at Ohio University to study the utilization of the habitat at Woodcock Nature Preserve by migratory songbirds.
