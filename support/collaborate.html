                <h3>Woodcock invites the reader, and any outside people and groups of good will, to collaborate with us, using the lands and facilities at the preserve as an asset. Collaboration with Woodcock can take many forms. Here are some examples of the unique collaborations happening between Woodcock Nature Preserve and affiliated groups:</h3>
            <p>– Jay Pickell and his group hunts white-tailed deer on the preserve, and trades their labor to mow the 5K Friendship Trail.</p>
            <p>– Southern Ohio Chestnut Company leases land from Woodcock, and controls invasive species on their leased land while providing trail access through their multi-species orchards.</p>
            <p>– The Rx Fire Co-op teaches landowners to conduct safe and lawful prescribed burns on their own property through a Workshop and a Learn-And-Burn at Woodcock.</p>
            <p>– Dr. Kate at the Athens County Municipal Diversion Program brings young people who have been arrested for misdemeanors to the preserve, to work on trail maintenance in lieu of serving time in jail and having a criminal charge on their record.</p>
            <p>– Dr. Kelly Williams maintains a tower in the Motus Wildlife Tracking System at Woodcock, to study songbirds. Data collected goes into research on the migratory patterns and habitat utilization of different species including tree sparrows.</p>
            <p>– Suzanne Michele Chouteau and the Urban Native Collective collaborated with Woodcock on the Land Acknowledgement interpretive sign.            </p>
            <p>– An anonymous donor paid for replacing the windows at the Farm House to lower the cost of heating and cooling in the indoor meeting space.</p>
            <p>– The Foundation for Appalachian Ohio and Davey McNelly helped bring the Farm House closer to being ADA compliant through an ADA audit. Following the audit, Woodcock built a wheelchair ramp, replaced and widened the front door, as well as widening the entrance to the first floor indoor bathroom, making it more feasible for people with movement disabilities to convene and attend meetings at Woodcock.</p>
            <p>– Many visitors provided feedback on the trail system so that a 5K loop from and returning to the visitor parking lot would be interesting and expose visitors to many different places in the preserve.</p>
            <p>– Local trail runners have organized and held several footraces on the 5K trail. Brittany Fitzgerald designed a flier for these events.</p>
            <p>– The Hocking College Wildlife Club planted a native species grassland restoration area in the southern half of the preserve, in partnership with Pheasant Unlimited.</p>
